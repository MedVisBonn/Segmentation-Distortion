Here you will soon find the step-by-step instructions to install and work with the methodology presented in our paper.

## Setup

### Git
If you want to test the code on your examples, simply clone the repository like this:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MedVisBonn/Segmentation-Distortion.git
```
### Docker
The easiest way to replicate the results of the paper is via docker. You can find the necessary resources in the docker directory.  
Build your own image:
The dockerfile itself should work as it is. Modify the -t option in build.sh to match your target directory and run
```bash 
bash build.sh
```
Alternatively, you can download a pre-build image from docker-hub:
```bash
TODO
```
Once the image is ready, modify the run.sh to mount datasets and run
```bash
bash run.sh
```
